      "\u001b[92mThis article is about a new neural network architecture called the Transformer, which is based solely on attention mechanisms and dispenses with recurrent and convolutional neural networks. The Transformer has been shown to perform better in quality than existing models, including ensembles, while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. The article discusses experiments on two machine translation tasks, achieving a new state of the art in both English-to-German and English-to-French translation. Additionally, the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks such as English constituency parsing. The article also includes visualizations of the attention mechanism used in the Transformer. The authors plan to apply the Transformer to other tasks and extend it to problems involving input and output modalities other than text. The code used for the experiments is available on GitHub.\u001b[0m\n",

      "\u001b[92mSelf-attention is calculated using multi-head attention. In the encoder and decoder stacks, each layer has two sub-layers, the first being a multi-head self-attention mechanism. In multi-head attention, the queries, keys, and values are linearly projected h times with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys, and values, attention function is performed in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional output values that are concatenated and projected resulting in final values. The attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. Scaled Dot-Product Attention is used for multi-head attention in the Transformer model, where the dot products of the query with all keys are computed, divided each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\u001b[0m\n",

      "\u001b[92mSelf-attention is computed using a multi-head self-attention mechanism followed by a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network in each layer of the encoder, with a residual connection and layer normalization around each sub-layer. The self-attention mechanism maps a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output using a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. The positional encoding used in the model corresponds to a sinusoid with the wavelengths forming a geometric progression. The self-attention layers have a total computational complexity that is faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length is smaller than the representation dimensionality, and the maximum path length between any two input and output positions is constant. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the training data consists of sentence pairs encoded using byte-pair encoding or word-piece vocabulary. The attention mechanism is observed to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\u001b[0m\n",
